It's been a ridiculously long time coming but **finally** got around to creating a personal site/blog. I've learnt way too much from other sites and blogs and feel like it would be selfish of me to not contribute anything back. If this blog helps one single person, it'll be worth it! 

I have no idea what I'm going to post about (not much of a writer) but we'll see what crops up. Probably a mix of technical and other random topics like music, sports and travelling. 

No turning back now!
