### Projects
Just a quick overview on what I've worked on in the past, what I'm currently working on and what I'm hoping to work on in the near future. This is more of a project to-do list of some sort:

- Currently a **Front End Developer @ Lloyds Bank** in London working on desktop and mobile interface implementation.
- **Personal website** - finally got the courage to set one up, hoping to update frequently while working on the layout/styling bit by bit.
- **[FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/)** - been looking for open source projects to contribute to and recently came across this project on github. Currently going through their curriculum (just curious to see what they've got on there) & hoping to contribute to the project as well.
- Management system for my company to keep track of transactions, expenses and other admin related tasks. I know there are plenty of great solutions out there but hey, what can I say, I just like to build things from scratch!
- An app to keep track of who owes you money (with transaction list per contact)
- Contribution to the community - increase contribution to the tech community on stackoverflow, github and on here.
- **[HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)** - be more consistent with solving tasks
- **[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)** - should start tackling these mathematical problems using NodeJS *soon*!
